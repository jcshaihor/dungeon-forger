# Dungeon Forger - IDLE RPG
Dungeon Forger is designed as a mobile game. It will be a 2D pixel idle RPG. This format allows players the freedom of not needing to engage with the game daily, aligning with the 'idle' concept. Players can assign tasks to their characters to be completed in their absence. As an RPG, the game is set in a fantasy realm where players forge their way into dungeons to gather resources. These resources are then used to forge stronger and more advanced items, enabling players to tackle increasingly challenging dungeons in search of rarer materials for crafting superior equipment. These tasks will have an idle aspect where the player can give instructions to their character to perform these actions until the player's next login. However, if time permits the player can do the dungeon runs and craft items themselves in real time.
